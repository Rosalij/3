  <h1>About this project</h1> 
    <p>This project is a book collection app built with Vue.js and Vite, with a backend web service for books published with in Render.
    I thought it would be a good idea to create a book collection app.
    I thought Vue was simple and easy to understand when everything is divided in components.
    It takes a while to learn but simple once you understand. It's something i would like to work with more.
    The harder thing about Vue was learning emits, twoway binding and props, which was new.
    I think Vue makes it easy to create easily understandable and maintainable code for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
